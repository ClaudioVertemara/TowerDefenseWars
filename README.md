# Description
This game was made as the 2nd project for the class CST 426: Advanced Game Development at CSUMB. It was inspired by the games Bloons Tower Defense and Mushroom Wars and was built by Claudio Vertemara, Josue Gonzalez, Mason Emura, and Riley Galloway.

# Controls / How to Play
In this game, you play as the blue army and your goal is to control the entire map by spawning troops and taking over all the towers on the map. The red team will likewise spawn troops and attempt to take over towers on the map and try to take over the entire map as well.

Use the left mouse button to select a tower you own (blue) and once a tower is selected, click on any other tower to send troops from the 1st tower to the 2nd.

Double left click a tower you own (blue) to change the tower type or the troop type. There are 2 tower types, Troop and Attack Towers. Troop towers will spawn troops while Attack towers will attack nearby ships moving. Both can contain troops.

There are also 2 types of troops, Fast and Strong. Fast are the default troops that spawn and move faster, but do less damage. Strong troops spawn slower and move slower but cause more damage. 

There is a conversion cost to changing the tower & troop type.

Left click on the background to deselect selected towers.
